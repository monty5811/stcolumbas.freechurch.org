We are thankful that once again we will soon be able to meet together for worship in our building.

As the restrictions still apply, there is a maximum of 50 in each service so we would ask again for your cooperation in filling out the service attendance form, indicating when you can join us in-person. **Please also note that we hope to have two services on Easter Sunday morning and you will see a 09.00 and 11.00 service for that day**.

We will be continuing to live stream the services, and are thankful to have been able to continue worshipping together in spirit in this way for many months. Please fill out the form below to indicate your availability for in-person services, and keep an eye on your email inbox for invitations to March and April services.

In order to facilitate and plan this, we need to have information about your availability. Once we have heard from everyone, then we will get back in touch with you to let you know when you are invited to attend.

It is very important to return this form to us. (contact *[help@stcsfc.org](mailto:help@stcsfc.org)* if you have any difficulties accessing it). If we do not have a form returned, then we cannot allocate a service invitation to you. Please fill in the form even if you have no plans to attend, are unavailable or have been told to self-isolate. We also only require one completed form per household or extended household.

**The deadline for submissions is the end of the day on Friday, 19th March.**
