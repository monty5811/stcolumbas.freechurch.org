From this coming Sunday, 6th June, we will be trialling our **new morning service time of 10.30.**

Please be sure to put it in your diary, set a reminder on your phone or put it in your calendar to help you remember. 

A few other things worth noting, some of which you will already be aware of: 

**Come in good time:** Please do not leave your attendance to the last minute before 10.30am. There will be a register at the door and social distancing will be required, so please take that into consideration when planning your arrival.

**Singing:** We don't yet know when we will be able to sing together as a congregation again but meanwhile, the rest of the service will be more or less formatted in the usual manner.

**Track and trace:** Your details, connected with your attendance, will be made available for the National Contact Tracing service if required, but will be destroyed after 21 days. If it transpires that someone who attended church on the above date has subsequently been tested positive, then you will be required to follow the tracing protocol. 

**Change in availability:** If your plans change and you become unavailable on any of these dates, or if you have any symptoms and cannot attend, please contact [help@stcsfc.org](mailto:help@stcsfc.org) to let us know.

**Building instructions:** There will be various instructions in place within the building.\
- Social distancing and a one way system will be in place\
- Hygiene facilities will be enhanced, and hand sanitising stations in place\
- Face coverings will be available if you do not have your own and wearing of face coverings is mandatory (unless medically exempt)\
- Seating will be allocated on arrival

**Parking:** Please be aware that Victoria Street is currently not accessible for cars, and is now double yellow lined on both sides of the street. Parking is no longer possible there or on George IV Bridge.

Despite all these restrictions, we are very much looking forward to welcoming you in church and having the opportunity to worship with at least some of the St Columba's family. God is good all the time!
