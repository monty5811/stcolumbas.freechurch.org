## Give and Pray Launch

On Sunday 14th November we launched our fundraising program to target increasing our ordinary income by at least £30,000 a year in order to allow us to invest further Gospel ministry: by expanding our current support structures and by developing new ministry initiatives.

We would love to be able to employ a church manager to develop and to support all we do as a congregation, as well as investing further in church planting, international mission support, Sparkle Sisters, strategic gospel initiatives that we partner with, and many other things.

We wholeheartedly believe that sacrifical giving is important. Alongside praying God's promises - and none more significant than his promise in Malachi 3:10:

> Bring the whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this,” says the Lord Almighty, “and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so much blessing that there will not be room enough to store it.

If you wish to make a one off pledge, start giving to the Gospel work in St Columbas for the first time or increase your current financial commitment, please visit [Give & Pray](https://stcolumbas.freechurch.org/give-and-pray)

Here you can see one way we could get to £30K:

## Special Collection

We also, held a special collection, as one of our monthly offerings, to help defray the relocation costs of bringing Cory and Heather and the family to Edinburgh from the USA, to become our Assistant Minister.

If you wish to contribute to this, please visit our [monthly offering page](https://stcolumbas.freechurch.org/monthly-offering).
