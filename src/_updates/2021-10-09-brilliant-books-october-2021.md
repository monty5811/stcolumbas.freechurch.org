**Love Your Church, Tony Merida**
Our Price: **£6.00** (25% off RRP)

This engaging book by Tony Merida explores God’s vision for the local church, looking at what the church is, why being part of it is exciting and why it is worthy of our love and commitment. This isn’t a book just for those in leadership roles but for all of us as ‘ordinary’ Christians: all of us are called to love and serve our church. By showing us the privilege of belonging to God’s family, Merida helps us to be church members who serve and love each other well.
