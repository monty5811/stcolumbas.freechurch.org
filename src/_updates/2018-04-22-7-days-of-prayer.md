​From Sunday 22nd November - Saturday 28th November 2020, we will be praying as a church family for new life and fruitfulness in our spiritual lives. We will be holding prayer meetings every morning at 7am during the week via Zoom and will join the rest of the Free Church in the annual National Day of Prayer on Wednesday 25th November.

See the Wednesday email for Zoom meeting details.

Each day we will focus on one of the fruits of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22-23).

**Sunday 22nd November - Love**  
“Since love grows within you, so beauty grows. For love is the beauty of the soul.”  
 *Augustine*

**Monday 23rd November - Joy**  
“Joy is not necessarily the absence of suffering, it is the presence of God.”  
 *Sam Storms*

**Tuesday 24th November - Peace and Patience**  
“As we pour out our bitterness, God pours in his peace.”  
 *FB Meyer*

**Wednesday 25th November - Kindness and Goodness (National Day or Prayer)**  
“Kindness makes a person attractive. If you would win the world, melt it, do not hammer it.”  
 *Alexander MacLaren*

**Thursday 26th November - Faithfulness**  
“Our responsibility is simply to make our witness faithful; it is God's responsibility alone to make it effective.”  
 *John MacArthur*

**Friday 27th November - Gentleness**  
“…with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love”  
 *Ephesians 4: 2*

**Saturday 28th November - Self Control**  
“Self-control is the exercise of inner strength under the direction of sound judgement that enables us to do, think, and say the things that are pleasing to God.”  
 *Jerry Bridges*
