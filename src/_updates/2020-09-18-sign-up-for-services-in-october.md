In September, we were able to return to the building for worship services on Sunday mornings. We are so thankful to God for bringing us to a point where this was possible, and have been reminded of how wonderful it is to meet with the family of God to worship Him together.

In October, in line with government guidelines, we will continue to be limiting attendance to a maximum of 50 people per service. There will continue to be no live evening services during October, but will be continuing to stream them at 5:30pm each Sunday evening. There will also be no Kids’ Church and Crèche provision in October.

We have been so encouraged to be able to welcome many into the church over this last month, and look forward to continuing to worship our Lord together in the coming month. We have been so glad to see new faces joining us each week, and we pray that this will continue!

We will keep to live streaming services in the morning and the evening, and we would encourage you to meet in homes to worship together on the weeks that you are not in the building itself (please remember to keep to the government guidelines). We have always encouraged this idea of church being much more than simply the gathering in the building on a Sunday - it is about people, and doing life together.

In the meantime, can we ask you to complete the form below (contact help@stcsfc.org if you have any difficulties accessing it) **by the end of the day on 27th September**. It’s really important that you return this form if you wish to worship with us in person. We would love to welcome you to church, and so please return the form below whether you are a regular at St Columba’s, if you are new to the city or if you are visiting us for the first time.

We're looking forward to seeing you soon!
