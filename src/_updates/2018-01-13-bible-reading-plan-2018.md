intro: |
  At St Columba’s we believe that prayerfully reading the Scriptures is critical to the Christian life, to growth, and our own spiritual formation. And because the whole Bible is God’s word, we must read it all! This year, we are going to engage as a community in a 52-week Bible reading plan. Of course, this is totally voluntary. But, we encourage everyone to join in and especially if you don’t already have a normal Bible reading schedule or have never read through the whole Bible.

As mentioned a few times over the past couple of weeks, we will be encouraging the use of a shared 2018 Bible reading plan for the whole congregation to participate in.

At St Columba’s we believe that prayerfully reading the Scriptures is critical to the Christian life, to growth, and our own spiritual formation. And because the whole Bible is God’s word, we must read it all! This year, we are going to engage as a community in a 52-week Bible reading plan. Of course, this is totally voluntary. But, we encourage everyone to join in and especially if you don’t already have a normal Bible reading schedule or have never read through the whole Bible. Because it is a 52-week plan, we can start it later than January 1. And because there is an Old Testament and New Testament reading 5-days a week, you will have some options on what days you read, if and when you need to catch up, and whether just reading through the New Testament this year might be right for you.

There is a link here to the schedule and we will have some printed and available this coming Sunday. **Day 1 for our reading plan is next Monday, January 15**. The readings will be added to our PrayerMate feed and we will also have one reading from our reading schedule in worship on Sunday and you can join in at any time.
