We can hardly believe that November is just around the corner, and that the days are already getting shorter as we go into the winter. November can sometimes feel like a bleak month but it is going to be a ‘bright November’ here at St Columba’s as we come together again to worship God as a church family in person, and online.

We will be continuing to live stream both morning (11am) and evening (5:30pm) services this month. However, in addition to the morning service, we will begin an evening service that can be attended! The maximum numbers for each of these services remains at 50, but we hope that an extra service each Sunday will help our November to be bright, as we have more opportunities to gather in the building for worship.

As well as the extra services, we will be celebrating the Lord’s supper together for the first 4 Sunday mornings, with hopes of a baptism on the 5th Sunday of this month. 

This month, we may be able to provide a limited Kids’ Church and Crèche facility but more information about these plans will be communicated in due course and will remain subject to change, so please keep an eye out for further information as it becomes available.

We would love to worship in person with you this month, whether you have been coming to St Columba’s all your life or have never been before. In order to attend an in person service, we need you to fill out the form by the end of the day on **Sunday 25th October**. If you have any problems with the form, please contact <a href="mailto:help@stcsfc.org">help@stcsfc.org</a>.
