**James For You, Sam Alberry (2015)** 

Sam Allberry’s book would be an excellent accompaniment to our studies on the book of James. The book explains, illustrates and applies the text to our lives in a clear and easy to understand manner. It is helpful in looking at the more challenging parts of James and provides useful definitions and questions for reflection - definitely one to have on hand over the next few months! 

Our Price: **£8.99** (25% off RRP)

**A Neglected Grace, Jason Helopoulos (2014)** 

This short book looks at the motivations and basis for family worship and encourages us to practice it in our homes. It gives plenty of practical help too: examples of what family worship might look like; answers to various questions and links to different resources. It’s a book that will make you excited about the privilege of worshipping God together in our homes. 

Our Price: **£6.99** (45% off RRP)

**Arlo and the Great Big Cover-Up, Betsy Childs Howard (2020)**

This children’s book is perfect for children aged 3 to 7. It’s filled with engaging illustrations and tells the story of Arlo learning that ‘cleaned up is better than covered up.’ It’s an enjoyable read with a clear emphasis on repentance and the forgiveness found only in Jesus.

Our Price: **£6.99** (30% off RRP)
