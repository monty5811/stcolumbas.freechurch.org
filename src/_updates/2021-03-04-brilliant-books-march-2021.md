Our next Brilliant Books spotlight is this Sunday and we have three wonderful books lined up for you to choose from, all at great prices. Each book is highly recommended, and once again, we’ve made it easy for you to order them straight to your home!



James For You, Sam Alberry (2015) 

Our Price: £8.99 (25% off RRP) 

Sam Allberry’s book would be an excellent accompaniment to our studies on the book of James. The book explains, illustrates and applies the text to our lives in a clear and easy to understand manner. It is helpful in looking at the more challenging parts of James and provides useful definitions and questions for reflection - definitely one to have on hand over the next few months!

A Neglected Grace, Jason Helopoulos (2014) 

Our Price: £6.99 (45% off RRP)

This short book looks at the motivations and basis for family worship and encourages us to practice it in our homes. It gives plenty of practical help too: examples of what family worship might look like; answers to various questions and links to different resources. It’s a book that will make you excited about the privilege of worshipping God together in our homes.

Arlo and the Great Big Cover-Up, Betsy Childs Howard (2020)

Our Price: £6.99 (30% off RRP)



This children’s book is perfect for children aged 3 to 7. It’s filled with engaging illustrations and tells the story of Arlo learning that ‘cleaned up is better than covered up.’ It’s an enjoyable read with a clear emphasis on repentance and the forgiveness found only in Jesus.
