St Columba's is accepting applications for a two-year training apprenticeship to start in the late summer of 2022.

This post has a part-time paid component for the church and consists of two parts:

1. Overseeing both administratively and relationally our Kidsâ€™ Church and Youth Ministries
2. Doing part-time study, which can be achieved through a number of options and does not have to be a full degree. Options in the past have included: BCUK, ETS Master's, Cornhill, ETS Saturday Course, and more.
