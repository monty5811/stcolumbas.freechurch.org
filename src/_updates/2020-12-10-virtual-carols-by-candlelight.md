You are warmly invited to join us as we celebrate and share the life changing story of Jesus at Carols by Candlelight on **Sunday 20th December at 5.30pm.** 

This year we will be coming together virtually to sing some of our favourite carols and hear the good news of the coming of Jesus Christ. 

Watch online at **stcsfc.org/virtual-carols** 

We hope to sing and celebrate the birth of our Saviour and give him praise with these songs: 

*Once in royal Davidâ€™s city*

*O little town of Bethlehem*

*O Holy Night* 

*O come all ye faithful*

*Hark the herald angels sing*

*Joy to the world*

We will also read God's word, pray together and Derek and Thomas will give short messages. There will be a chance to give back to those in need as well as hear a new hymn performed by the church band.

Hope to see you there.
