Over the past two years, St Columba's has been developing a training programme for local church ministry. Thomas Davis, our Assistant Minister shared that “It has been a real encouragement to see our training programme develop further and it has been great to see our team expanding with the new trainees who started with us this September.” 

Here, our new interns, Mairi and William, tell us a bit about themselves and their roles. 



Mairi Murchison (Ministry Apprentice) 

“I have been in Edinburgh the last four years, completing an undergraduate degree in Linguistics & English Language. During that time I have loved being a part of St Columba’s Free Church. The ministry apprenticeship is such a wonderful opportunity for me to be taught and mentored, to study and to serve. I am so grateful to be here for the next two years and I am looking forward to all that lies ahead!

One of my main responsibilities will be working with the Den, our ministry for young teenagers. I am excited to study the Bible with them, to encourage them in their faith and to help equip them with a robust biblical worldview. I will also be doing Biblical Counselling UK’s certificate course which I hope will give me the biblical wisdom to develop a godly character and disciple others well. 

My hope is that I will be humble and teachable, taking this opportunity to learn from the godly, wise people I am surrounded with and becoming more like Jesus. I pray that I will be able to serve St Columba’s faithfully throughout my time here, living wholeheartedly for God and seeking his glory in all I do.” 



William MacSween (Ministry Apprentice)

“I’m William, I’m 22 years old, and I’m originally from a village called Dunkeld in Highland Perthshire. I moved to Edinburgh in 2016 to study a music degree, and joined St Columba’s shortly after, where I have been since! 

Like many, Covid-19 meant that my plans for 2020 had to change significantly. I had originally hoped to spend a year at Sabhal Mòr Ostaig, a Gaelic college on the Isle of Skye, but with the restrictions I realised this wouldn’t be possible. I also increasingly felt led back to Edinburgh, so after much thinking and praying, I got in touch with Derek about the possibility of doing an apprenticeship - to which he and the leadership kindly agreed!  

Over the course of the year, my role will be focused on helping to develop the music and worship, but as well as that I’ll be helping out with Kids’ church and Identity. I’ve been a part of both the music team and Identity throughout my time in St Cs so far, and so I’m delighted to be able to continue my involvement there. I’m also excited to serve in Kids church, which will be a new experience for me!

I’ve been especially aware of God’s presence with me over the past few months, particularly through answered prayers. My hope is that I’m able to use this year for his glory - that I would grow and mature as a Christian, and that I would use every opportunity I’m given to serve others and the church.”



Please keep both Mairi, William and the rest of the staff in St Columba’s in your prayers, as they seek to glorify God and navigate serving in the church community during the pandemic.
