The opportunity to establish your own identity is part of what makes moving to a new city as a student or young worker so exciting.


At St Columba’s, our student and young workers group, Identity, aims to equip you with what you need to live out your identity as a child of God in Edinburgh (Romans 8:16) and to be a disciple-maker wherever you are.

> The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,
> Romans 8:16

Usually we meet together every Sunday, alternating each week between lunchtime and evening sessions. These offer the chance to build and develop friendships, and a talk which aims to answer a ‘big question’ or issue facing young Christians in today’s world, with follow-up discussion on the topic. Whether this runs as normal, in small groups or online, we hope that Identity will help you to grow in your love for Jesus, and equip you to live out your faith.

If you’re a student or young worker hoping to move to Edinburgh in the next few months, we’d love for you to join us as St Columba’s! Our services are livestreamed online and in person, but we really want to encourage you to meet with us in person. 

Our service times are 10.30am and 5.30pm, and we’d love to welcome you to join us. 

If you have any questions about what being a student or young worker at St Columba’s looks like, please email [office@stcolumbas.freechurch.org](mailto:rowan.corrigan@stcolumbas.freechurch.org).
