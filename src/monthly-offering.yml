            We usually take an offering each month to give to a different project or charity or other good cause. Due to COVID-19 restrictions we have moved this offering online.

            The monthly offering for October is in support of Compassion UK <a href="https://www.compassionuk.org" target="_blank">compassionuk.org</a>
            </p>
            <p>Compassion UK works in 25 countries to help children and young people be empowered to overcome poverty. This is achieved through the personal sponsorship of children, which as well as funding practical support for the children, individuals here have a connection with the children they sponsor to build confidence, share God's love for them as well as pray for them.</p>
            <p>St Columba's currently sponsors two children, Samuel from Kenya and Javier from Guatemala. Messages from them can be seen in the downstairs hall. This month's offering will go towards their sponsorship costs.
