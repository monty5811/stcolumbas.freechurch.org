    # Monthly Offering

    <p>
    We usually take an offering each month to give to a different project or charity or other good cause. Due to COVID-19 restrictions we have moved this offering online.
    </p>

    <p>
    This month’s special collection is to support the calling of the Rev Cory Brock as our Assistant Minister. There are a number of costs associated with Cory, his wife Heather and their 4 kids moving to Edinburgh from America e.g. travel costs, visas, accommodation costs so we are raising funds to support their move. We are very excited to be welcoming the Brocks back to St Columba’s in the first week of December!

    # Give & Pray
    
    Today, we are also launching a new goal of raising an extra £30,000 a year in our regular giving for each of the next 3 years.
    We are prayerfully aiming to raise this amount (on top of our existing income) to further equip the work of St Columba's as we continue to be a city-centre church committed to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

    You will hopefully have heard a lot more about this at this morning's service (14th November).
    If you missed it keep an eye out for future communications.

    Today you can do one of three things:
    
    <div class="prose mb-8">
    <ol>
    <li>Create a new standing order - contact our <a href="mailto:finance-manager@stcsfc.org">Finance Manager (Kerry)</a> for our bank details</li>
    <li>Increase your current standing order - you can do this via your bank</li>
    <li>Make a pledge to start giving regularly or to increase your current giving</li>
    <ol>
    </div>

    If you want to make a pledge, just fill in this form:
