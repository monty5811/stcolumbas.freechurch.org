            Our offering this month is in support of Tearfund.
            </p>
            <p>
            Tearfund is a Christian charity that works alongside local churches and other organisations in over 50 countries around the world to help communities overcome the effects of poverty and disaster.
            </p>
            <p>
            As a result of the recent volcanic eruption in the Democratic Republic of Congo, there is currently an emergency appeal, which our offering will be going towards The DRC is already a country torn apart by civil war and poverty, making it one of the hardest countries to live in.
            </p>
            <p>
            Funds raised in this appeal will go in the first instance towards providing clean drinking water and sanitation in the emergency camps, but will also help to provide farming tools and training in the long term to help people there get back on their feet.
            </p>
            <p>
