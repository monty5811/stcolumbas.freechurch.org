            We usually take an offering each month to give to a different project or charity or other good cause. Due to COVID-19 restrictions we have moved this offering online.

            Our offering this month is in support of our AV equipment upgrade.
            </p>
            <p>
            At the last meeting of the Deacons' Court it was agreed that outdated AV equipment would be replaced. The estimated cost of this is £9,200. Over the last year we have all been blessed with being able to take part in the services from home and the new equipment will make the streaming of services easier for the AV team and make the process more robust for whatever lies ahead in this form of ministry. The Deacons' agreed that the February offering would be used as an opportunity for the congregation to contribute towards the cost of the equipment.
