            We usually take an offering each month to give to a different project or charity or other good cause. Due to COVID-19 restrictions we have moved this offering online.

            This month our offering is going towards Dumisani Theological Institute, a theological seminary in King William’s Town on the Eastern Cape of South Africa. Dumisani has a personal connection to St Columba’s through our elder Rev Billy Graham, who aided in establishing the Bible college which went on to become Dumisani Theological Institute.
            </p>
            <p>
            The word ‘Dumisani’ means ‘praise’ in Xhosa, so come along on Sunday evening to hear more about the seminary from Billy and praise God for how he has blessed this ministry over the decades.
