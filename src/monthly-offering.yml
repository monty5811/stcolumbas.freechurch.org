            We usually take an offering each month to give to a different project or charity or other good cause. Due to COVID-19 restrictions we have moved this offering online.

            This month we are excited to introduce a new mission partner for the congregation! Our monthly offering for April is for the ministry of Matthew and Maria Lingard, who live and work in Athens, Greece. The Lingards serve in a variety of ways, from helping those in poverty to university outreach. They were sent as missionaries from both Kilmallie and Ardnamurchan Free Church (Matthew’s home church) and Christ is the Change Church in Buenos Aires, Argentina (Maria’s home church). We are delighted to welcome Matthew and Maria to our mission focus service this Sunday (24th April) for a live interview via Zoom. Come along to (virtually) meet the Lingards and hear about their work in Athens!
