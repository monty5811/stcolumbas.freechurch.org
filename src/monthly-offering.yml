            We usually take an offering each month to give to a different project or charity or other good cause. Due to COVID-19 restrictions we have moved this offering online.

            The monthly offering for January is in support of 20Schemes. 20Schemes want to see Scotland's housing schemes transformed by the gospel of Jesus Christ through the revitalisation and planting of gospel-preaching churches, ultimately led by a future generation of indigenous church leaders.
            </p>
            <p>
            They are currently supporting four congregations in Edinburgh and further information can be found on their <a href="https://20schemes.com/" target="_blank">website</a>.
