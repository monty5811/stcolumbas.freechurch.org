            We usually take an offering each month to give to a different project or charity or other good cause. Due to COVID-19 restrictions we have moved this offering online.

            Our offering this month is in support of our Compassion.

            The offering this month is in support of Navigators. They are an organisation who disciple students and encourage them in their relationship with Jesus. From this the hope is that they will then grow to love, support and equip those around them in their walk and evangelism. Further information on their ministries in Scotland, including the work in Edinburgh led by our own Colin Gillies, can be found on their [website](https://navigators.co.uk/scotland).
