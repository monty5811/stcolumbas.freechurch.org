            We usually take an offering each month to give to a different project or charity or other good cause. Due to COVID-19 restrictions we have moved this offering online.

            This month the offering is in support of the "Safe Families Christmas Appeal".
            </p>
            <p>
            They write, "Your gifts will support us as an organisation as we seek to come around families who are struggling. Donations will also go to families who need practical things such as clothes, shoes, cots, beds, kids car seats, food, nappies, personal items and often a food voucher is a life changer, especially at Christmas when having very little is felt even more strongly by the children and families."
