       City Group Sundays are a chance to spend a little longer in each others’ company on a Sunday afternoon.
       They are a time where people can show hospitality by opening their homes and providing a meal for others in the group, and normally happen on the third Sunday of the month.
       Of course, there’s no requirement on you to host if you go to a group, but it’s there to help you build friendships.

        The Den and iDen are our ministries to teenagers in the congregation. We meet together fortnightly for a time of friendship, food and discussion over the bible or big topics that are going on in the world today. We believe that high school is one of the crucial times for defining and exploring the faith that will carry teenagers on into life at college, university or the working world. This is why we want to provide a space for asking questions and exploring who Jesus is while also being able to meet others their own age.

       Connect Meals runs on the first Sunday of the month.
       These meals give everyone the chance to host people, meet new people and build community in a growing congregation.
       There are a couple of coordinators who arrange some hosts for any given weekend, and then it’s just up to you, if you feel like going to someone’s for a meal and to get to know them better, to sign up.

       The Old Farm Court is a sheltered housing accommodation unit, in Colinton, for those aged 60+.
       On the second Sunday of each month an hour-long worship service, led by someone from St Columba’s, is held for its residents.
       The residents at Old Farm Court love to have visitors and so we try to encourage two or three from our congregation each month to enjoy fellowship with them.
       Currently we have about 25-30 people who come along which is great and it is an excellent opportunity to present the Gospel to those who have not heard it before.

       There is a growing group of children in the church.
       We love them and want to care for them, teach them and help them enjoy their time as part of the church family as much as possible.
       Kids’ church happens during the morning sermon and all ages are catered for.
       Each class utilises age-appropriate resources to illustrate and apply Bible teaching.
       Our teachers and helpers are all PVG checked, trained and are enthusiastic participants who work together in teams to look after the kids.

      The opportunity to establish your own identity is part of what makes moving to a new city as a student or young worker so exciting.
      [Identity](https://stcsfc.org/identity) is our group for students and young workers which aims to equip you with what you need to live out your identity as a child of God in Edinburgh (Romans 8:16) and to be a disciple maker wherever you are.
      We meet together every Sunday, alternating each week between lunchtime and evening sessions.
      Each session involves eating together, the chance to build and develop friendships, and a talk which aims to answer a ‘big question’ or issue facing young Christians in today’s world, with follow up discussion on the topic.

       At St Columba’s we want to support people to grow in their faith and deepen their personal relationship with Jesus at every stage of their lives.
       One way of doing this is through the discipleship programmes we offer.
       These programmes are based in small groups to promote accountability and develop relationships within the church as well as encouraging spiritual growth.
       In addition to these programmes one-to-one discipleship is also available for those who would benefit from a more individualised approach.

       In St Columba’s we don’t run our own programmes but link up with existing charities to help bring relief and comfort to those who are disadvantaged and in need.
