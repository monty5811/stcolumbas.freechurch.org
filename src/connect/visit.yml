    ## What To Expect

    We are an intergenerational community with Jesus at the centre of everything we do. Our services consist of singing, prayer, scripture reading and preaching.

    All our sermons are online so you can [check them out](http://sermons.stcolumbas.freechurch.org/) ahead of time.

    The service usually lasts for about 1 hour, during which you are free to sit and just observe.
    You don't need to participate in the singing or anything that makes you feel uncomfortable, and you're not required to make any kind of donation.
    If you have recently started coming to St Columba's and you'd like us to have your details so we can connect you to the life of the congregation 
    and a [City Group](/connect/teams/community), please visit [stcsfc.org/new](https://stcsfc.org/new).

    ##Sunday Services

    Our Sunday morning service is at 10:30 am and our evening service is at 5:30 pm. The services follow similar formats, but the content of each will be different. We celebrate Communion twice a month. When you arrive at the church a member of the Welcome Team can give you a Bible if you need one, and show you to a seat if it is busy.


    Following the morning service, we serve tea and coffee in the Main Hall and you are welcome to stay around, chat, ask questions and find out more

    ### What about Children?

    Our Kids' Church (age 4 up to P7) meets during the 10:30am service.
    There is also a crèche available during the morning service for babies and toddlers up to age 3. We have a large and experienced team of volunteers with full PVG disclosures.
    
    In addition to the crèche facilities there is a feeding room for those who have need of it. If in doubt, please just ask for directions or follow the signs

    ### Mid-Week Meeting

    On the 2nd and 4th Wednesday evenings of the month we meet in the Main Hall for our midweek meeting. This usually involves a short Bible based message, often with more practical application and interaction, followed by sharing of prayer points and a time of prayer together in small groups.

    On the 1st and 3rd Wednesday evenings of the month, we meet in different homes across the city in our [City Groups](/connect/teams/community) where we have a time of fellowship and Bible study.
