      Mission is at the heart of who we are and what we do. We are committed to sharing the good news of Jesus Christ with the people around us through our words and actions. In addition to sharing the gospel personally with our friends, families, and neighbours, we are also engaged in making Jesus known through acts of justice and mercy, social action, planting new churches in our city, and by supporting the mission of God’s people internationally.

      Sparkle Sisters is our ministry for women in Edinburgh who have been affected by homelessness or adverse social circumstances. Our mission is to provide a place where they will experience joy and feel valued. One of the ways we do this is through regular events of pampering, friendship and community. Our hope is to build up lasting and committed friendships that will provide new community for the women of our city.

      We are committed to being a church that plants new churches. We recognise that one of the greatest challenges we face as a church in 21st century Scotland is the huge number of people who have little or no exposure to the good news of Jesus Christ. We believe that planting new churches is an effective and biblical way to bring the message of Jesus to the unreached people of our city and its environs.

      We have recently seen our first church plant, Cornerstone, become a congregation in its own right, and we are still the overseeing church for our church plants: Esk Valley Church in Midlothian; Haddington Community Church in East Lothian.and most recently, Winchburgh in West Lothian. We are excited about the prospect of planting even more churches in our city.

      While much of our missional activity is focused on our own doorstep here in Edinburgh, we recognise that as Christians we are also part of something much bigger than ourselves: we are members of the global body of Christ. We are passionate about supporting the mission of the Church internationally, through financial assistance, prayer and encouragement, and by helping to train leaders. Over recent years we have been able to provide help and support to mission work in places such as Nepal, Russia, and South America.
