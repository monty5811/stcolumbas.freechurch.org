      We recognise the importance of doing practical things well and as efficiently as possible with limited resources.
      We seek to communicate well online and in person, and have effective structures in place to help run the church family in the best way possible.

        We look after the sound and screens on a Sunday, manage the website and run a few other techie things behind the scenes. Much of what we do is unseen, but we do our best to help the life of the church run smoothly.
        You donâ€™t need any prior experience to join the team, so please get in touch if you are interested in helping out.
