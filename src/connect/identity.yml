      ## What is Identity? 
      
      The opportunity to establish your own identity is part of what makes moving to a new city as a student or young worker so exciting.
      Identity is our group for students and young workers which aims to equip and explore what it means to live out your identity as a child of God in Edinburgh (Romans 8:16) and to be a disciple maker wherever you are.
      
      We meet together every Sunday to discuss a big question or issue facing young Christians in today’s world, as well as to build and develop friendships with one another, and pray together.

      ## Host Families
      
      We want our students to feel at home as they worship with us at St Columba’s. One way in which we hope to do this is by having host families for students. These are families or individuals who look out for our students, having them in for food (in line with government guidelines!), building close relationships and encouraging them to live boldly for Jesus. Whether it’s getting you out of your 3 x 3 meter halls room, or being a friendly face when you are feeling homesick, we pray that our host families will provide a home away from home for our students.
      
      If you have any questions or would like any more information about anything to do with being a student with us at St Columba’s, please contact Rowan at [rowan@stcsfc.org](mailto:rowan@stcsfc.org).
