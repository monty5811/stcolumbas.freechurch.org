    This short Bible verse helps us see what it means to be a community in church.
    To love one another, and to provide for one another is a practical way of expressing our sense of being a family together, and of following the example of Jesus.

        City groups are our midweek house groups where we not only socialise and share hospitality, but we study the Bible together and pray.
        If the normal Sunday service is ‘big’ church, then this is ‘small’ church.
        These groups are normally regional throughout the city and overseen pastoral teams led by elders.
        These are gospel communities whose aim is to share life and faith together in a variety of ways and a great opportunity to introduce their wider circle of friends and others to the Christian faith.

        Open Book is a space for women in the congregation to meet, have a cuppa and a discussion, with the help of a well-chosen resource (bible study/article/book).
        Our aim is to provide a time of friendship, support and encouragement as we chat, share and pray together.
        We meet monthly during term time on a Friday morning, 9.30 - 11.00 am, usually at Annie Graham’s flat.
        Babies and pre-schoolers are very welcome which can make for a ‘lively’ discussion environment!
        We try to provide a crèche with a helper so that mums can come and enjoy the conversation too.

        We enjoy fellowship together and then alternate between doing a Bible study led by one of us, and having a talk by a missionary/speaker.
        All are warmly invited to join us of any age.

        The Men's Meeting is an informal gathering of men (mostly senior citizens) for discussion and friendship.
        The meetings take place every two weeks at 2.30pm on a Thursday, usually in the St Columba’s Church Hall, with refreshments being shared at the beginning of the meeting.
        Invitations are extended to men from all the city Free Churches and we have discussion topics that cover a wide range of interests.
