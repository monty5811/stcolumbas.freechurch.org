    <p>This short Bible verse helps us see what it means to be a community in church. To love one another, and to provide for one another is a practical way of expressing our sense of being a family together, and of following the example of Jesus. </p>

    <h3><strong></strong>City Groups
    </h3><p>City groups are our midweek house groups where we not only socialise and share hospitality, but we study the Bible together and pray. If the normal Sunday service is ‘big’ church, then this is ‘small’ church. These groups are normally regional throughout the city and overseen pastoral teams led by elders. These are gospel communities whose aim is to share life and faith together in a variety of ways and a great opportunity to introduce their wider circle of friends and others to the Christian faith</p>

    <h3><strong></strong>Open Book
    </h3><p>Open Book is a bible discussion time for all women in the congregation in the 20s and 30s age group, and any friends they would like to invite along.

    <h3>Men's Fellowship Meeting</h3><p>The Men's Meeting is an informal gathering of men (mostly senior citizens) for discussion and friendship. The meetings take place every two weeks at 2.30pm on a Thursday, usually in the St Columba’s Church Hall, with refreshments being shared at the beginning of the meeting. Invitations are extended to men from all the city Free Churches and we have discussion topics that cover a wide range of interests.
