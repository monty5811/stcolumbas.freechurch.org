    This short Bible verse helps us see what it means to be a community in church.
    To love one another, and to provide for one another is a practical way of expressing our sense of being a family together, and of following the example of Jesus.

          City groups are our midweek house groups where we not only socialise and share hospitality, but we study the Bible together and pray.
          If the normal Sunday service is ‘big’ church, then this is ‘small’ church.
          These groups are normally regional throughout the city and overseen pastoral teams led by elders.
          These are gospel communities whose aim is to share life and faith together in a variety of ways and a great opportunity to introduce their wider circle of friends and others to the Christian faith.

          Open Book is a bible discussion time for all women in the congregation in the 20s and 30s age group, and any friends they would like to invite along. Open Book provides a space where we can get together, talk and have any children looked after for a while, as there is also the crèche provided.
          We meet fortnightly during term-time, from 9.30am – 11.30am on a Thursday morning and usually at a different location each time, which will be advertised.
