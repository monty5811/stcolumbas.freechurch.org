    We recognise that every Christian has a gift, and we believe that we are all called to serve God and the Church in some way.
    But we also recognise that in a busy city-centre community, it can sometimes be hard to keep track of everything that is going on!

    Our Ministry Teams, composed of men and women with various gifts and abilities, help us to structure our various groups, activities and areas of service into clearly defined categories.
    For example, if you want to find out about our ministry to students and young workers, take a look at the [Discipleship page](/connect/teams/discipleship)! 

    Each team has responsibility for managing, under the oversight of our elders and deacons, their own relevant sub-groups.
    Our Ministry Teams help us to have some clarity by providing a big picture view of what we do, and enable us to have a clear focus on doing all that we do, from preaching and praise to welcoming visitors and serving coffee, to the glory of God.
