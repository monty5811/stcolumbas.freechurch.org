      Give & Pray
      
      Today, we are also launching a new goal of raising an extra Â£30,000 a year in our regular giving for each of the next 3 years.
      We are prayerfully aiming to raise this amount (on top of our existing income) to further equip the work of St Columba's as we continue to be a city-centre church committed to the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

      You will hopefully have heard a lot more about this at this morning's service (14th November).
      If you missed it keep an eye out for future communications.

      Today you can do one of three things:
      
      <div class="mb-8 prose">
      <ol>
      <li>Create a new standing order - contact our <a href="mailto:help@stcsfc.org">help email</a> for our bank details</li>
      <li>Increase your current standing order - you can do this via your bank</li>
      <li>Make a pledge to start giving regularly or to increase your current giving</li>
      <ol>
      </div>

      If you want to make a pledge, just fill in this form:
