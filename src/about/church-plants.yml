title: Church Plants
intro:
  left: "Scotland is, according to recent church attendance statistics, an unreached country for the gospel. We see the effects of this in our city, yet rather than just self-preserve, we want to go out with the good news of Jesus and plant churches.\r\r\n\nPlanting churches is no new thing - every church anyone has ever been in was, at one time, a new church. So rather than seeing church planting as a fad, the leadership at St Columba’s see starting new churches as the most effective way to take the gospel out into a culture which, by and large, has rejected the mainstream institutional church in Scotland."
  right: "Almost every area of the city would benefit from having new, outreaching churches acting as salt and light. At present we have started a church in Morningside, and are working towards starting one just south of the city in Midlothian. These have been small groups of people from St Columba’s who have felt called to begin a new work in the part of the city where they live. Mostly, the way we do this is by being a community together, and by trying to reach out relationally to those we live and work amongst during the week.\r\n\r\nWe sense the challenge of doing this, and feel ourselves to be very small - but we recognise at the same time how great God is, that all the necessary resources are his and that He has the power to build His church."

      ## Cornerstone

      In early 2014, we planted a new church in the Morningside / Bruntsfield
      area of the city. We want this church to be for those who are not
      religious and would never normally consider being part of a church. We put
      a high value on relationships and community and are working hard to be a
      group of friends who are accepting, open and honest. The congregation are
      a multi-generational group made of up of a variety of people and families.
      Some of us have been Christians a long time and others are new to
      Christianity. We are at various stages of belief and understanding, so it
      is a good place to come along to explore and ask questions even if you are
      not a Christian personally. A lot of the time we are just about being
      friends and doing the kind of stuff that friends do. Every Wednesday
      evening we all come together to share a meal and then spend time studying
      the Bible, applying it to every-day life and praying. Some of us meet for
      prayer in the mornings and we like to hang out together on a Sunday
      afternoon.

      ## Esk Valley Church


      Esk Valley Church is the second plant out of St Columba’s. It meets in
      Midlothian to the immediate south of Edinburgh. Midlothian is an expanding
      region with newly developed transport links joining up Edinburgh and the
      Scottish Borders. It’s also an area with a huge need for the gospel, and
      for new churches to be started.


      We launched a couple of years ago, and meet on Sunday mornings in the
      Scottish Mining Museum in Newtongrange at 10.30am. During the week we meet
      in people’s homes, to look at the bible, pray, and share life together.
      Some of us are Christians, some are exploring Christianity, and some
      coming back to the church after being away for a time. We really want EVC
      to be a place people can know good friendship, and grow in their
      understand of who God really is. We are working out what it means to know
      God & worship Him, grow in our faith, serve others out of love, and
      witness to the good news about Jesus.

      ## Haddington Community Church

      Haddington Community Church is a new congregation in the early stages of
      being planted in the centre of East Lothian. There is a great need for
      gospel churches in the area as the population grows rapidly, but the
      number of people attending churches who have a living faith remains small.
      We have a real mix of ages and church backgrounds, and currently gather on
      Sunday afternoons to spend time looking at the bible together and praying.
      Our goal is to build a community grounded in God's word who will be
      welcoming to all, seeking to grow in our love for Jesus, and serving one
      another and those around us as we share the gospel. As we do all this we
      seek to be a prayerful people as we depend fully on God's grace.

      We are hoping to publicly launch morning services in the second half of
      2018 as we look to reach more people in Haddington and the surrounding
      towns with the good news of Jesus Christ. For more information please
      contact [Ali Sewell](mailto:ali.sewell@gmail.com).
