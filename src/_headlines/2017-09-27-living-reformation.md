  In October, Protestants across the world celebrate the 500th anniversary of the Reformation.
  Specifically, the 31st of October 2017 is the 500th anniversary of Martin Luther’s call for a debate.
  He nailed the 95 theses, or theological statements, on the church doors in Wittenberg in order to publically discuss issues about the church’s understanding of sin, forgiveness, repentance, Scripture, and authority.
  It was this moment that is often thought to be the starting point of the historical movement called the Reformation, which led to the development of what we now call the five solas: Scripture alone, grace alone, faith alone, Christ alone, and the glory of God alone.

At St Columba’s, throughout the month of October in our evening service of worship at 5:30pm, we will celebrate the principles of the Reformation by looking at these five truths as the Bible itself presents them.
While looking back at the Reformation of 500 years ago with thankfulness and honour, we continue to look at Scripture today to consider what it means to be living reformers as part of a living reformation of church and worship for the 21st century.

We invite you to join us.
