intro: During the months that we can’t meet in person at St Columba’s we want to
  continue to encourage one other in the gospel and live alongside each other as
  a church family as much as we can. These ‘Humans of St Columba’s’ videos are
  one of the ways we hope to do this as we hear from individuals in the
  congregation about how God has and is working in their lives, and we’re
  starting off with a series of videos on the topic, ‘Where do you find your
  hope?’
