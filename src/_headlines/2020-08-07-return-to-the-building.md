We are planning to start our morning services on Sunday 6th September.

In line with government guidelines we will be limited to a maximum of
50 people initially but we hope to be able to increase numbers and available
services in October subject to any changes in the government guidelines.

As all of this is new and challenging - we are starting of with a staged
approach to get used to the various protocols that need to be followed. There
will be no Kids’ Church and Crèche provision in September. But we hope that by
October there will be Kids' Church, Crèche and an in person evening service.

Despite all these restrictions, we are so looking forward to welcoming you in
church and to having the opportunity, at last, to worship with at least some of
the St Columba’s family. God is good all the time!

We will be continuing to live stream services in the morning and the evening,
and we would encourage you to meet in homes to worship together on the weeks
that you are not in the building itself. We have always encouraged this idea of
church being much more than simply the gathering in the building on a Sunday -
it is about people, and doing life together. 

In the meantime, can we ask you to return the form below (contact
[help@stcsfc.org](mailto:help@stcsfc.org) if you have any difficulties accessing it). 
It’s really important that you return this form if you wish to worship with us
in person. We would love to welcome you back to church, and so please return
the form below whether you are a regular at St Columba’s, if you are new to the
city or if you are visiting us for the first time.

We are looking forward to seeing you soon!
