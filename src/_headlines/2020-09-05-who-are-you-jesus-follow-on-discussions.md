If you have been watching our recent* [Who are you Jesus?](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLF73r3ezO-0ridr5Sle2jT-IeUygnu0at)* series (or even if you haven't!), why not sign up to join Derek and others for four Sunday evenings during September and October to look at four people Jesus met and what it means to respond (or not) to the claims of Jesus. Feel free to take a friend along with you!

To sign up go to: [stcsfc.org/more](https://stcs.elvanto.eu/form/?id=8598e2dc-a9d3-460b-b45f-314215955fe9) to let us know and when you sign up, we will give you a journal copy of Johnâ€™s Gospel to read and scribble on!

The four people Jesus met that we will be looking at are:

* Scared (Nicodemus: John Chapter 3)
* Isolated (Woman at the well: John Chapter 4)
* Cynical (Pilate: John Chapter 18)
* Doubting (Thomas: John Chapter 20)

**Time**

7.30pm on Sundays: 20th September, 27th September, 4th October and 11th October

**Venue**

With the tighter restrictions, we will now meet on Zoom (sorry!). Contact [derek@stcsfc.org](mailto:derek@stcsfc.org) if you plan to attend and we will send you a Zoom Invitation link.

We look forward to seeing you!
