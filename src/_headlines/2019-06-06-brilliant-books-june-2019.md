**Prayer, Eric Alexander**

We talk a lot about talking to God, but sometimes it can be daunting to get beyond the basics. In this book, renowned Scottish minister and writer Eric Alexander guides us through the Biblical basis to prayer and how to place it at the centre of our spiritual lives. There is also reassuring encouragement in the section on specific problems that all believers face as we pray.

_Our Price: £4.50 (21% off RRP)_

**Before You Open Your Bible, Matt Smethurst**

This brand new pocket-sized book is approachable, grounded, witty and excellent. Taking the reader through nine brief chapters, the author looks at the different heart attitudes we must bring towards all Bible study. Short, powerful, and one of the best books to be released so far this year. Buy one for you and a friend!

_Our Price: £1.50 (50% off RRP)_

**What Every Child Should Know About Prayer, Nancy Guthrie & Jenny Brake**

The latest in the ‘Every Child Should Know’ series, this book picks up on the prayer theme, but is beautifully written and illustrated. A treasure in itself, it relentlessly points the young reader to God. Great for children and parents to read together!

_Our Price: £5 (50% off RRP)_
