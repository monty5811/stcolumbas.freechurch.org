**Dig Into Matthew, Chris Ranson (2020)**

Thomas Davis took a special look at this book, and here’s what he has to say: 

> 'Dig Into Matthew' is a 50 day guide to the gospel of Matthew. Each day, you read a passage of Matthew, along with a short 2 page explanation of the passage in the book. The great message of the book is that Jesus is King, and that through faith in him we can be part of his kingdom too.
> 
> 
> The book is written in a very accessible style - the language is very clear and easy to follow. Each day, the book explains what you are reading in Matthew and it is very good at addressing sections that could be confusing or that raise questions.
> 
> 
> Alongside the explanations of Matthew, the book is also full of brilliant illustrations. These are very effective - they help explain key concepts, they are used to show the connections that Matthew makes with the Old Testament, and they help unpack Jesus's message and mission.
> 
> 
> At the end of each daily reading, there are some questions to think about. These are really helpful for applying the emphasis of the passage to daily life.
> 
> 
> 'Dig Into Matthew' is a really helpful guide, both for daily Bible reading in general and for the gospel of Matthew in particular. The language is very accessible, so the book is great for teenagers as well as adults. It is an excellent accompaniment to our current sermon series, 'Moving through Matthew'.
