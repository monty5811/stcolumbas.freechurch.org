</p><hr style="border-color: #909194;"><p>Coming to our annual Weekend Away is an opportunity to spend quality time together, eat amazing food, fellowship together and strengthen the church family as we take time out to meet with God. We would especially recommend it if you are new to the congregation. It takes place at Lendrick Muir, a Scripture Union centre situated a few miles from Kinross, easily accessible from Edinburgh. There are a variety of different types and sizes of bedrooms available so we can accommodate everyone’s needs – please consider coming, especially if you have not been before… you will have fun! The Weekend Away is open to anyone who comes to St Columba’s regardless of age and stage. We would love to see you.

</p><p>We like to be able to offer activities for the school and nursery aged children during the morning talk on the Saturday and Sunday. Someone will organise the activities, but we are looking for a few willing volunteers to help them out on the day! We will also be running a crèche for babies and toddlers at the same time, and are looking for a couple of folk who would be willing to sit with the children while they watch a DVD on Saturday evening. If you are willing to do any of these please indicate on the booking form.
