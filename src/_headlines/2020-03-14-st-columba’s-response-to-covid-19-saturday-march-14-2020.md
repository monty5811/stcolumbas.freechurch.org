The elders wish to give an update for everyone in circumstances that are rapidly changing.

**This Sunday 15 March (Tomorrow)**

We will meet as planned, but please remember the guidelines we have already issued with

some further advice added.

* Do lots of rigorous handwashing
* There will be no handshaking on arrival – just smiles and welcoming words
* Bibles or bulletins will not be handed out, but will be available for individuals to pick up.
* No tea and coffee will be served
* Seating will be spaced out.
* Kids church and crèche will be on as normal, but contact will be kept to a minimum
* Those who are elderly or who have underlying health issues are discouraged from attending. We will endeavour to keep in contact and help in any way we can. A link is available to watch the service live ([stcsfc.org/livestream](https://stcolumbas.freechurch.org/livestream))
* Extra cleaning has been done this week in the church building to ensure the best hygiene.

**Moving Forward**

Please be aware of all the advice currently being circulated regarding how best to stop the spread of Covid-19. The situation is changing rapidly and it is very likely that we will be suspending church services in the near future. We will give weekly updates and develop ways of supporting each other.

From Monday 16th March we have decided it is wise to suspend all small group gatherings until further notice. That includes City Groups, bible studies and other small group meetings organised by St Columba’s. Staff will be encouraged to work from home.

Pastoral teams for each City Group area will be given separate advice and suggestions as to how best to keep in touch together, how to look after the elderly and vulnerable, and how to show care and compassion within society at this time of unprecedented shutdown. We hope the pastoral team leaders will make that information available to all in their area.

In all of this, may we call out to God in prayer, remember that in His sovereign love he has not abandoned us but loves us, and that this is a time for trust and not unbridled fear – a time to serve others as best we can as we show them where our hope lies.

Pastoral teams will have details of who to contact within their area, but if you seek further assurances or need assistance in any way, prayerful or practical, please contact Derek (07741304410)
