  "​​Come join us this Sunday, 1st April, as we celebrate the hope of life in Jesus Christ, the God-man risen from the dead!"

Sunday, 1st April 2018, at 11am

We human beings were made for life, not death.
The only hope for us who face death is the hope of resurrection.
Come join us this Sunday as we celebrate the hope of life in Jesus Christ, the God-man risen from the dead! We will enjoy having our kids with us during worship, a message for them, and a look at Mary Magdalene's encounter with the risen Christ in John 20.
