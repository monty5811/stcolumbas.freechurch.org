Carols by Candlelight is a fantastic event to invite your friends and family along to!
Come and join us as we sing some of our favourite carols together and hear the good news of the coming of Jesus Christ.
Then stick around afterwards to enjoy mince pies, mulled wine, and one another’s company.
All within the beautiful candlelit setting of St Columba’s at the top of the Royal Mile.

If you have Spotify, you can listen to some of our favourite songs from Carols by Candlelight from the last few years: [http://stcsfc.org/spotifymus](http://stcsfc.org/spotifymus)

See you there, at 5.30pm on Sunday 17th December.
