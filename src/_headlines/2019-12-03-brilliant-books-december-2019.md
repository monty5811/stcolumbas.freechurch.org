**Is God Green?, Lionel Windsor**

This is a really fantastic book that gives a solid, biblical and hopeful framework through which to look at the current environmental issues of the world. It gives us reasons for why we as Christians should not despair at the state of our world, neither be complacent about the clear brokenness around us. Perfect to challenge your thinking, or to give as a gift to someone who has a particular care for environmental issues.

_Our Price: £4.50 (25% off RRP)_

**Do You Pray?, J.C. Ryle (with Mary Davis)**

This timeless book from a giant of the faith is short, easy to read, and great for young and old. A perfect aid to making the good habits you begin during our 7 days of prayer stick for the longer term. It might even be worth considering if any of the friends you have been praying for might be open to reading it with you! It’s been lightly edited and updated into modern English, so there’s no excuse not to grab (at least) one now. 

_Our Price: £1 (75% off RRP!)_

**If I were in charge of Christmas, Helen Buckley & Jenny Brake**

Imagine if you had the chance to arrange the birth of the Saviour of the world. You’d make it flawless, right? No dirt, only well-behaved donkeys, and definitely a softer cradle. So why didn’t God do it that way? This cheery little book is the perfect way to give young children a fresh perspective on the nativity.

_Our Price: £2_
