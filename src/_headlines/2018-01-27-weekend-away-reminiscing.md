  "It has been through going to the church weekends away that I have felt really at home at St Columba’s - living in community together even for a short weekend brings so much joy and laughter and can provide a space to rest and consider God’s goodness again."

It’s been a few weeks since the St Columba’s Weekend Away and we've been reminiscing over the good times. Our lovely Jenni Galloway shares her experience of this year’s trip:

“The church Weekend Away is in Lendrick Muir, a large homely Christian conference centre near Kinross. It’s a great opportunity to get away from normal life, enjoy each other’s company, build relationships, deepen friendships, enjoy great food and be encouraged and challenged from God’s word.

It has been through going to the church weekends away that I have felt really at home at St Columba’s - living in community together even for a short weekend brings so much joy and laughter and can provide a space to rest and consider God’s goodness again.

Highlights for me this year included listening to the bible teaching and coming away challenged about living a life centred on Jesus, playing games and getting to know people in the congregation I’d never spoken to before and exploring the beautiful creation around us since there is lots of free time to get outdoors.”
