St Columba's invites you to Psalm Praise! Last year we shared in a wonderful evening of worship at the Celtic Praise night and we would love you to join us again for an evening where we will explore the message of the ancient songs of the bible to the music of our Scottish traditions.

Psalm Praise! will be taking place on Sunday 1st March at 5.30pm at St Columbaâ€™s Free Church, Johnston Terrace, Edinburgh, EH1 2PW (opposite the Hub).
