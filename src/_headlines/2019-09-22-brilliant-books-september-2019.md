[**A Meal with Jesus, Tim Chester**](https://www.10ofthose.com/uk/products/10927/a-meal-with-jesus/?partner=freechurchbooks)

Hospitality can feel like a daunting word, but the whole point of ‘A Meal with Jesus’ is that it doesn’t need to be. It’s all about welcoming others and sharing what you have in Jesus’ name. Taking six meals from Luke’s account of Jesus’ life, Tim Chester explains the ways in which Jesus used gathering over food to reach out to those who needed Him most. It’s an excellent book, and its message is for everyone. If you already have it, is there someone you know who would benefit from its encouragement?

_Our Price: £6.50 (35% off RRP)_

[**True Friendship, Vaughan Roberts**](https://www.10ofthose.com/uk/products/16347/true-friendship/?partner=freechurchbooks)

This book is an ode to the importance of friendship. Friendships inside the church, as much as outside, require hard work, sensitivity, honesty and love. Sometimes this can be easy, but often it is not. Touching on a range of relevant issues, Vaughan Roberts emphasises the truth that only Christ can provide perfect friendship, and that only out of a secure and meaningful relationship with Him can we be a true friend to others. 

_Our Price: £2 (60% off RRP)_

[**Big Bible Science, Erin Lee Green**](https://www.10ofthose.com/uk/products/20456/big-bible-science/?partner=freechurchbooks)

Faith and science are not opposites, and this book is jam-packed full of Bible verses, scientific detail, and fun experiments to prove it. Whether you teach a Kids’ Church class, have an inquisitive small child or know school-age kids who are struggling to reconcile their science lessons with their Bible, this book is for you. You might learn as much as them
