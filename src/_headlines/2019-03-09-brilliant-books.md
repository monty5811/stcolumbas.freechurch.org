  The first Brilliant Books spotlight is coming up on Sunday 16th March, and
  we’ll have three great books for you to buy at bargain prices.

Whether you naturally enjoy reading or not, good Christian books can make a huge difference to your walk with God. They can add to what we hear in sermons or look at in City Groups, and they don’t have to be heavy or boring. This is why every three months we’ll be having a Brilliant Books spotlight; to highlight some of the best Christian books available, and to give you a chance to buy them at rock bottom prices!

Here are the books we've got for you this time:

**Enjoying God, Tim Chester**

As Christians, our joy in God should be at the heart of everything we do and say, but all too often it gets overshadowed by the cares of today and the fears of tomorrow. In this book, Tim Chester reminds us that the heart of our faith, and the promise of our salvation, is of a relationship with all three Persons of the Trinity. And that relationship should, and can be, one that is filled with delight. This book is engaging, easy to read, and does what it says on the cover - helps you to enjoy God!

_Our Price: £5_

**The New City Catechism Devotional, Tim Keller (ed)**

We are already going through the 52 questions of the New City Catechism in our Sunday services, and this devotional is designed to sit alongside and dig a bit deeper behind those questions. Drawing together wisdom from contemporary and historical Christian leaders, each day comes with a Bible text and a short prayer. This book is a resource to be used time and again, even long after we have finished our focus on the Catechism. 

_Our Price: £12_

**Are We Nearly There Yet?, Alison Brewis & Jenny Brake**

This rhyming children’s story takes the reader on the disciples’ confusing journey as they waited for Jesus to be revealed as King. Beautifully illustrated and easy to read, this is the perfect book to share with young children around Easter time, and great to give away too. 

_Our Price £2_
