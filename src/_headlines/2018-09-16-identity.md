  The opportunity to establish your own identity is part of what makes moving to
  a new city as a student or young worker so exciting. Identity is our group for
  students and young workers which aims to equip you with what you need to live
  out your identity as a child of God in Edinburgh (Romans 8:16) and to be a
  disciple maker wherever you are. We meet together every Sunday, alternating
  each week between lunchtime sessions and evening sessions, as outlined in the
  schedule (below). Each session involves eating together, the chance to build
  and develop friendships, and a talk which aims to answer a ‘big question’ or
  issue facing young Christians in today’s world, with follow up discussion on
  the topic.
